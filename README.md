# Locator App

This is a personal project that I built because since moving from NY to CA, when I drive, I often wonder where I am, and I don't want to ask Google while driving because it means turning down my music while on the road. Instead, I keep this progressive web app ready and just refresh when I need to know what city I'm in. I also get the temperature, so that I can put into numbers just how hot (but dry, not humid like back home) CA gets. I like knowing where I am because I find myself in different parts of Los Angeles and some surrounding areas and save a lot of food spots to my Google Maps. West Coast cuisine is different from back home. LA is an entirely different kind of city from NYC.
