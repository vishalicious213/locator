# Locator App

This is a personal project that I built because since moving from NY to CA, when I drive, I often wonder where I am, and I don't want to ask Google while driving because it means turning down my music while on the road. Instead, I keep this progressive web app ready and just refresh when I need to know what city I'm in. I also get the temperature, so that I can put into numbers just how hot (but dry, not humid like back home) CA gets. I like knowing where I am because I find myself in different parts of Los Angeles and some surrounding areas and save a lot of food spots to my Google Maps. West Coast cuisine is different from back home. LA is an entirely different kind of city from NYC.

That said, this project focuses on working with APIs, in this case the Open Weather API for temperature, weather and city name data and the Google Maps Platform for the map. I make use of asynchronous JavaScript via `async` and `await` and geolocation information via Google Maps.
